    "hometext":"The defense industry is an essential component of the world economy and prime mover in the balance of power in today's world. Defense spending has been on the rise due to countries' attempt to counter the ascendance of other countries' weapons technology. This competition has ushered in a technology arms race that, since the termination of the Cold War, has produced a number of new defense doctrines.",
    "footertext":"One such doctrine is the importance of 'network-centric', in contrast to 'platform-centric' warfare, often considered the greatest military revolution of the past century. This doctrine stresses the importance of weaning defense off heavier industries in favor of complete control over information and network management. This shift has contributed to and benefitted from tidal shifts in economic, trade, and information technology development.",
